Yelp-Reviews-NLP-Project

Implemented an NLP pipeline using Python libraries like SpaCy and Gensim to preprocess Yelp review data, applied TF-IDF vectorization, and created predictive models with RandomForestClassifier. Utilized the KD-Tree algorithm for Nearest Neighbors and employed Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling to identify common themes in reviews, demonstrating the ability to extract valuable insights from textual data.
